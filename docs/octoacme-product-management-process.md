- Maintain product roadmap alignment with organizational priorities

## Core Activities Throughout Project Lifecycle

### Ideation & Discovery
1. Conduct market research and competitive analysis
2. Gather and analyze customer feedback and pain points
3. Define problem statements with measurable success criteria
4. Create product hypotheses and validation plans
5. Collaborate with stakeholders to align on business objectives

### Initiation & Planning
1. Create Product Requirements Document (PRD) with clear acceptance criteria
2. Define success metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs)
3. Prioritize features in the product backlog using frameworks (e.g., RICE, MoSCoW)
4. Collaborate on technical feasibility and resource estimation
5. Align roadmap with Project Manager on timeline and dependencies

### Execution & Development
1. Participate in sprint planning and backlog refinement
2. Provide ongoing clarification on requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Review and approve feature designs and prototypes
4. Conduct user testing and validation sessions
5. Make scope and priority decisions based on new information

### Release & Launch

3. Identify opportunities for optimization and new features
4. Update product roadmap based on learnings
5. Share insights and recommendations with stakeholders

## Decision-Making Practices

### Prioritization Framework
- **Customer Impact**: Will this solve a real customer problem?
- **Business Value**: Does this align with revenue and growth goals?
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build this effectively with available resources?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Does this support our product vision and roadmap?

### Data-Driven Decisions
- Use quantitative metrics (usage, conversion, retention) and qualitative feedback
- A/B test feature variations when possible
- Document decision rationale in Product Decision Log
- Regular review of assumptions and course-correct when needed

### Stakeholder Collaboration
- Weekly alignment meetings with Project Manager and engineering leads
- Monthly roadmap reviews with leadership and key stakeholders
- Quarterly business reviews with cross-functional teams
- Ad-hoc consultations for urgent decisions or scope changes

## Communication & Reporting Cadence

### Regular Communications
- **Weekly**: Product-Engineering sync to review progress and blockers
- **Bi-weekly**: Stakeholder updates on roadmap progress and metrics
- **Monthly**: Product review with leadership covering KPIs and strategic initiatives
- **Quarterly**: Roadmap planning and OKR reviews

### Key Artifacts & Documentation
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Product roadmap and release plan
- Success metrics dashboard
- User feedback and research insights
- Product Decision Log
- Competitive analysis and market research

## Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template
- **Product/Feature Name**:
- **Problem Statement**: What customer problem are we solving?
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?
- **Target Users**: Who is this for?
- **User Stories**: What will users be able to do?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know when it's done?
- **Dependencies**: What do we need from other teams?
- **Timeline**: When do we need this delivered?
- **Risk Factors**: What could go wrong?
- **Open Questions**: What do we still need to figure out?

## Stakeholder Management

### Key Stakeholder Groups
- Engineering teams (for feasibility and implementation)
- Project Managers (for delivery coordination and timeline)
- Sales and Marketing (for go-to-market and customer insights)
- Customer Support (for user feedback and pain points)
- Leadership (for strategic alignment and resource allocation)

### Communication Strategy
- Tailor messaging to stakeholder needs and concerns
- Provide regular, proactive updates rather than waiting for requests
- Use data and customer stories to support recommendations
- Create shared understanding through documentation and artifacts
- Escalate decisions that require stakeholder input or approval
