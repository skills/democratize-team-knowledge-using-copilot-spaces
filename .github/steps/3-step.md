## Step 3: Create an issue and pull request to improve project management processes

In this step, you will practice iterative process improvement by:

1. Creating a GitHub issue using an issue template to document needed improvements to personas/roles in project management processes
2. Using GitHub Copilot's coding agent to automatically create a pull request that implements these improvements

This demonstrates a complete improvement workflow: identify gaps (issue) ‚Üí implement solutions (pull request) ‚Üí maintain traceability (linked in Copilot Space).

### üìñ Theory: Iterative Process Improvement

Effective process evolution follows a lightweight cycle:

- Review current documentation and execution reality
- Identify gaps, ambiguities, or missing personas/roles
- Record the need as a structured issue (problem statement + rationale)
- Design and implement improvements (docs, templates, checklists) in a PR
- Communicate changes via clear descriptions and linked artifacts
- Measure adoption and revisit as new insights emerge

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **GPT-4.1** model for all conversations with Copilot Spaces.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Attach an issue template and create an issue for process improvements

_Use the following prompt in a new Copilot Space conversation:_

- Select your repository

  > ```text
  > {{full_repo_name}}
  > ```

- Select the issue template to this new Copilot Space conversation. </br>
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml`

  > Use the attached issue template
  > - Identify potential new personas/roles that could be added to the project management processes documentation
  >   to enhance clarity and accountability.
  > - Create an issue titled "Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes"
  >    that outlines the need to expand the defined roles and responsibilities in the project management documentation.
  > - Make sure the new roles/personas have descriptions of their responsibilities and how they interact with existing roles.
  > - The issue should detail why this is important, potential personas to add, and how it will improve project outcomes.
  > - add to the process document `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md`

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Attach an issue and create a Pull Request

_Use the following prompt in the current Copilot Space conversation:_

In the same Copilot Space conversation do the following:

1. In this activity we will attach the issue you created in the previous activity
2. This will assign the issue to the coding agent to create a pull request with an update to our personas/roles document in the `docs/` folder
3. Copy and paste the url for the issue that we created in the previous activity. </br>

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Make sure the issue below matches the issue you want to attach
> - Hit **\<SHIFT\> + \<ENTER\>** so you don't start Copilot working on the conversation

Check issues list: [https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues](https://github.com/{{full_repo_name}}/issues) </br>

> ```text
> @{{full_repo_name}}/issues/4

Select **Allow**

   <img width="50%" height="50%" alt="Copilot coding agent allow" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0c92c04-d12b-4c5e-b682-33643b90ee11" />

You should have gotten a notification that Copilot coding agent is working on your pull request.

Go to your repository and click **Pull requests** and you should see something similar to the following:
