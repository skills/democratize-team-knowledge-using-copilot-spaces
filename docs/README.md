# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive introduction to OctoAcme's project management methodology, designed to help teams deliver successful projects through clear processes, roles, and artifacts.

## Core Principles
- **Customer-First**: All decisions prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative Delivery**: Projects are delivered in small, testable increments
- **Clear Ownership**: Each project has dedicated Project and Product leadership
- **Data-Informed**: Decisions are based on measurable evidence
- **Psychological Safety**: Teams foster an environment of open feedback and learning

## Key Roles and Responsibilities
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Oversees delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, manages backlog, and measures success
