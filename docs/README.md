# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme’s project management process is built on clear roles, iterative delivery, and strong communication. Projects start with a well-defined initiation phase, using a one-pager to outline the problem, goals, stakeholders, and success metrics. Planning breaks work into actionable increments, prioritizes the backlog, and identifies dependencies and risks. Execution is managed through daily standups, weekly syncs, and a project board workflow, emphasizing small pull requests, automated testing, and regular demos. Releases follow a standardized checklist to ensure quality and minimize risk, with clear rollback and incident response procedures.

Roles are well-defined: Project Managers coordinate delivery and communication, Product Managers set vision and priorities, Developers build and test features, and QA ensures quality. Stakeholders are kept informed through regular updates and milestone reviews. Risks are tracked in a register and managed proactively, with escalation paths for blockers and incidents. Continuous improvement is embedded through retrospectives after each milestone, focusing on actionable learnings and celebrating improvements.

Communication is frequent and structured, with weekly PM/Product syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. All key artifacts—charters, roadmaps, backlogs, risk registers, and retrospective notes—are maintained for transparency and alignment. The process encourages psychological safety, data-informed decisions, and customer-first thinking.

Overall, OctoAcme’s project management ensures projects are delivered efficiently, with high quality and stakeholder alignment, while fostering a culture of learning and improvement.
