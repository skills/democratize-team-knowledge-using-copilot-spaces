## Step 1: Create and Prime Your Copilot Space

In this step you will establish a Copilot Space and give it the minimum context it needs to act as a project management knowledge hub for OctoAcme.

### What you will do now

1. Create a new Copilot Space (this is the container for all subsequent conversations).
2. Add high‚Äëlevel Instructions (purpose, where process docs live, why the Space exists).
3. Attach (add as a Source) your cloned exercise repository so Copilot can index `docs/` and issue templates.
4. Confirm the repository finishes indexing (appears in Sources).
5. Start a conversation in the Space to generate an issue that will track creating a README summarizing OctoAcme project management processes and linking every document in `docs/`.

### Copilot usage requirements (apply to every conversation here)

- Model: **GPT-4.1**
- For pull request draft generation: include the phrase `Using the github-copilot-agent tool` in your prompt (PR drafts use the GHCP coding agent).
- Keep prompts explicit about desired outputs (issues, summaries, links).

### Readiness checklist before proceeding

- You can access https://github.com/copilot/spaces
- You have (or will fork) the exercise repository
- You know your GitHub handle to build the repository URL

Proceed to the activities below to execute each action.

[Use Copilot Spaces](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces/)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In all conversations with Copilot Spaces, always be aware of the following:
> Use the **GPT-4.1** model
> Pull request drafts utilizes **GHCP coding agent**, therefore your prompt should contain `Using the github-copilot-agent tool`

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add your cloned repository as a source repository to your Copilot Space

1. In your newly created Copilot Space, look for **Add sources** button
1. Add this exercise repository as a source:
   - Start to type the name of your repository `/{{full_repo_name}}` and select it from the dropdown
   - This gives Copilot access to the project management documentation and processes in the repository
1. Select the `docs` folder
1. Verify the repository appears in your sources list

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create an issue in the repository for a README for OctoAcme Project Management Docs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the **GPT-4.1** model for all conversations with Copilot Spaces.

- Open your Copilot Space you created above. https://github.com/copilot/spaces
- In the conversation interface prompt the following:

   > ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Prompt-text?style=social&logo=github%20copilot)
   >
   > ```prompt
   > Create an issue in the repository for a README for OctoAcme Project Management Docs
   > that has links to all the docs in the docs folder.
   > - The README should also contain a brief summary of the project management processes used by OctoAcme.
   > - Make sure README, project management processes summary, and links are in the title of the issue.
   > ```

You can then add this issue to your repository by clicking the **Create** button.
